            <p class="lead">One of the paths for an individual to obtain permanent resident status in the U.S. is through employment.  If the foreign national is in the U.S., he or she can apply for adjustment of status.  If the foreign national is outside the U.S., he or she can go through immigrant visa processing at an overseas U.S. embassy.</p>
            <p class="lead">The employment based (EB) "preference immigrant" categories include:  EB-1, EB-2, EB-3, EB-4, and EB-5</p>
            <p class="lead"><i>EB-1 is the first preference category.</i> The sub-categories for this visa are:</p>

            <li class="lead bullet">Multinational managers or executives</li>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"><i>EB-2 is the second preference category.</i> The sub-categories for this visa are:</p>
            <li class="lead bullet">A foreign national with advanced degree</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">A foreign national of exceptional ability</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">A foreign national seeking a National Interest Waiver</li>
            <br>

            <li class="lead bullet">skilled workers</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">professionals</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">professionals</li>
            <br>
            <p class="lead"><i>EB-4 is the fourth preference category.</i> The sub-categories are numerous and some examples include, but are not limited to: religious workers, international employees of the US Government abroad, and members of the armed forces.</p>
            <p class="lead"><i>EB-5 is the fifth preference category.</i> This category covers entrepreneurs making certain investments in the US (capital investment) and meeting special criteria which include the creation or preservation of US jobs. </p>

For example, for E-1, E-2, and H-1B1 (an alien from Chile/Singapore) visas, a petition is only required in some cases (change of status / extension of stay).</p>
