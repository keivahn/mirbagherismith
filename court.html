            <p class="lead emphasize">Removal Proceedings</p>
            <p class="lead">Individuals who are found to be removable are placed in administrative proceedings before an Immigration Judge.  Once the individual is found removable, he or she can apply for one or more forms of relief to avoid being ordered removed/deported from the U.S.  Our office has successfully obtained the following types of relief for clients in removal proceedings:</p>
            <li class="lead bullet">Bond</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Voluntary departure</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Adjustment to permanent residence status </li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Cancellation of removal and adjustment of status for certain permanent and nonpermanent residents (including special rule for battered spouse or children)</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Asylum, Withholding of Removal and Protection under the Convention Against Torture Act</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Waivers of inadmissibility for fraud, misrepresentation, and/or crimes.  These waivers are generally obtained in conjunction with adjustment applications; however, returning lawful permanent residents charged with certain grounds of inadmissibility may file a standalone application</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Admission to the U.S. as a returning permanent resident </li>
            <br>
            <p class="lead emphasize">Motions and Administrative Appeals</p>
            <p class="lead">An individual may move to reopen and/or reconsider a previous decision by filing a timely motion with the Immigration Judge.  The filing of such motions does not suspend the execution of a removal decision unless a "stay of removal" is granted by the Immigration Judge, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), DHS, or the individual seeks to reopen an <i>in abstentia</i> order (an order issued by an Immigration Judge when the individual was absent at the proceedings).</p>
            <p class="lead">When an individual or DHS disagrees with the decision of an Immigration Judge, the decision can be appealed to the BIA (motions to reopen and/or reconsider can also be filed with the BIA).  The BIA can either dismiss or sustain the appeal, remand the case back to the Immigration Judge, or, in rare cases, refer the case to the Attorney General for a decision.  A precedent decision by the BIA is binding on DHS and Immigration Judges throughout the country unless the Attorney General modifies or overturns the decision. </p>
            <p class="lead emphasize">Judicial Review</p>
            <p class="lead">Under the immigration laws, the Federal Courts of Appeal have the authority to hear certain decisions appealed from the BIA.  In certain circumstances complaints can be filed directly with the District Court.</p>
            <p class="lead">Our federal litigation practice has included:</p>
            <li class="lead bullet">Petitions for review filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Complaint filed with the District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the legality of subjecting adjustment applicants to the "Controlled Application Review and Resolution Program" (CARRP) under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and Due Process clause.</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Writ of Mandamus filed with the District Court for the District of Columbia challenging the unreasonable delay in connection with the adjudication of an application for permanent residence status.</li>
            <li class="lead bullet">Complaint for declaratory and injunctive relief filed with the District Court of the District of Columbia under the APA in connection with the denial of an extraordinary ability petition by the USCIS Administrative Appeals Office (AAO).</li>
